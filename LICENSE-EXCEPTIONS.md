# Sikhi Studio licensing exceptions

Sikhi Studio is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License,
version 3 or later** (AGPL-3.0-or-later). The full text is in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE). See [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) for this project's
relationship to upstream Concat, from which it is forked.

The additional permission below is granted by the copyright holders on top of
that license. It grants rights; it never takes any away. If you ignore this
file entirely, plain AGPL-3.0-or-later applies and you are still compliant.

## The Sikhi Studio Plugin Exception, version 1.0

### Why this exists

The **Sikhi Studio API** is a stable interface that lets plugins, scripts, automation
and MCP integrations extend the editor without forking it.

Without this exception, a plugin that links against the Sikhi Studio API would form a
combined work with Sikhi Studio, and the AGPL would reach the plugin's own
source.
That is not the intent. The copyleft is here to keep *Sikhi Studio itself*
— the engine, the compositor, the renderer, the editor — open. It is not here to
dictate the license of software that merely talks to it.

### The grant

As a special exception, the copyright holders of Sikhi Studio give you permission to
combine an Independent Module with Sikhi Studio to produce a combined work, and to
convey the resulting combined work, **without the Independent Module itself
becoming subject to the requirements of the AGPL**, under the conditions below.

An **Independent Module** is a module that:

1. is not derived from, and does not incorporate any part of, Sikhi Studio's
   source code; and
2. interfaces with Sikhi Studio exclusively through the Sikhi Studio API, its
   plugin entry points, its command/IPC surface, or its documented file and
   project formats.

### Conditions

This exception applies only while all of the following hold.

1. **Sikhi Studio stays AGPL.** Every portion of Sikhi Studio in the combined work — the
   original source and any modification you make to it — remains licensed
   under AGPL-3.0-or-later, and you meet the AGPL's obligations for it,
   including the source-offer requirement of section 13 when the combined work
   is made available to users over a network.
2. **The API is the boundary.** The Independent Module reaches Sikhi Studio only
   through the interfaces named above. Statically or dynamically linking
   against Sikhi Studio's internal crates, vendoring its source, or reproducing a
   substantial portion of its code in your module places that module outside
   this exception.
3. **No relabelling.** This exception does not permit conveying Sikhi Studio, a
   modified Sikhi Studio, or a substantial portion of Sikhi Studio under terms
   other than
   the AGPL by describing it as a plugin, a host, a runtime, or a bundled
   dependency of an Independent Module.
4. **Trademarks are separate.** This exception grants no rights in the Sikhi
   Studio name or logo. See [`TRADEMARK.md`](TRADEMARK.md).

### Notes

If you modify Sikhi Studio, you may extend this exception to your version, but you
are not obliged to. If you do not wish to do so, delete this file from your
version.

Nothing here limits the permissions the AGPL already grants you, and nothing
here is a licence to any patent beyond what AGPL-3.0-or-later section 11
already provides.
