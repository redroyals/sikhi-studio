# The notes for a release or a nightly, from the commits it is made of.
#
# Usage: release-notes.sh <since-ref> <until-ref> <title> [nightly]
#
# Writes markdown to stdout: what changed, as the subjects of the commits
# between the two refs; how to install each bundle; the checksum file; the
# licences. The commits are the changelog - each subject on main is written
# as a sentence a user can read - so there is no second file to keep in
# step with them.
#
# What a release note is for is what somebody running the app can notice, so
# three kinds of subject are dropped on the way past. Housekeeping, by its
# shape: formatting, lock files, "Update foo.rs". Anything typed as work on
# the tree rather than on the product - a conventional-commit `test:`,
# `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `refactor:`, `style:` or `docs:` says so
# itself. And a fix that only got the build green again: a lint appeased, an
# import removed, a file moved to please a compiler is not a fix anybody
# asked for.
#
# A subject that survives is printed as a sentence. A `feat(studio):` in
# front of one is scaffolding for the log and reads as noise in a release,
# so the type comes off and the first letter goes up. A subject that appears
# twice appears once.

### Download

| | Apple silicon | Intel / x86_64 | arm64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | `macos-arm64.dmg` | `macos-x86_64.dmg` | |
| Windows | | `windows-x86_64.zip` | `windows-aarch64.zip` |
| Linux | | `linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `linux-aarch64.tar.gz` |
| Android | | | `android-arm64.apk` |
| iOS / iPadOS | | | `ios-arm64.ipa` |

Every bundle runs with nothing else installed.

- **macOS**: open the `.dmg` and drag Sikhi Studio to Applications. If macOS says
  the app cannot be checked, right-click it and choose Open once.
- **Windows**: unzip and run `concat.exe`. The FFmpeg libraries beside it
  stay beside it.
- **Linux**: `tar xzf` the archive and run `./concat` from the folder;
  `concat.desktop` is there for a launcher.
- **Android**: open the `.apk` on the phone and allow the install from
  this source; Android 8.0 or newer, 64-bit.
- **iOS / iPadOS**: sideload the `.ipa` with AltStore, Sideloadly or
  Xcode's Devices window, which sign it with your Apple ID; iOS 15 or
  newer.

`SHA256SUMS` lists each file's checksum.
